This is only an adapter to integrate pnp graphs to your icinga-web interface, you must install pnp4nagios separately. 
After successful installation you should see a new icon in your host and services overview which display the pnp graphs for the host/service 
when being clicked upon.

And now let's answer the questions:

1) How can I change the position of the icon?
	1. go to %icinga-web%/app/modules/Cronks/data/xml/grid/
   2. In icinga-host-template.xml AND in icinga-service-template.xml there is a section called fields which represent the columns in your overview
   3. Search for the field called "image_hover" and cut&paste it to the position you like
   4. Clear the cache (rm -r %icinga_web%/app/cache/config

2) My pnp4nagios is not installed under http://my.host.com/pnp4nagios 
	1. Follow steps 1 and 2 from 1). 
   2. Below "image_hover" there is a section called arguments (below parameters), which holds an url field. 
   3. Change this url
   4. Clear the cache (rm -r %icinga_web%/app/cache/config
