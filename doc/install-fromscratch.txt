Install icinga-web standalone from scratch

1) Prerequisits

Based on the fact that you have a running mysql and php (with PEAR) environment. Also icinga and ido are running
you can continue with the second step.

2) The place and dependencies

Get the source and copy icinga-web to a place you like (e.g. /usr/local/icinga-web). You should have
a icinga-api too or get one an copy it to you lib path you want

3) Php dependencies

Test the php dependencies. Go to the etc directory and call the phing test script:

	../bin/phing testdeps
	
All required tests should pass succefully. Maybe you have to alter the php.ini for the
framework.

4) Database installation.

4.1) Manually creation

Create a database and a user you like. The user must have default data privileges like
SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE. Import the schemes

	etc/database/deploy/init.sql
	etc/database/deploy/db-deploy.sql

to your database. Thats all

4.2) Auto creation

Create a database user with scheme and data privileges (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, INDEX). Go to the
etc dir and copy the build.properties to a save place (e.g. /tmp). Alter the database
settings within the properties file. You can also set you database root user to create
your scheme. Call the phing deploy task:

	../bin/phing -Dproperties=/path/to/your/build.properties db-initialize

You have to manually create a database user to access your database. Add the default data
privileges that icinga-web can work with the newly created database.

5) Icinga-web settings

Alter the configfiles:

app/config/databases.xml
	Change the credentials for your database connection

app/config/icinga.xml
	Go to the appkit.factories section and change the path and the credentials for the icinga-api

6) Apache settings

Go to the pub directory and changes the .htaccess file. You have to alter the RewriteBase direction
to suite your needs.

7) Try

Go to the webpath and try if the webinterface starts without exceptions (database connections web
and api). You can login with user 'root' and password 'password'
